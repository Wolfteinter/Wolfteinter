### Hello there â˜•
I'm Onder Francisco but i call myself Wolfteinter a simple guy who has as many dreams as bugs :bug: in his code, today I am a web/desktop application developer but I would like one day to work in computer science research. 
I spend my days reading :book:, playing video games ðŸŽ®, working on personal and group projects, and trying to solve ICPC problems.
